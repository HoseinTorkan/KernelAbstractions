/// Domain events are typically raised by aggregate roots and dispatched after
/// the aggregate has been successfully persisted.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="OccurredOn"/> is expressed as a <see cref="DateTimeOffset"/> so
/// that the instant is unambiguous regardless of the storage or display
/// time zone, and so that events can be ordered reliably.
/// The property is read-only on the interface so implementations are free to
/// use <c>init</c> or a private setter; the only contract is that the value is
/// available after construction.
