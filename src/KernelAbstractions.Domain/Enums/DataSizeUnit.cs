/// <para>
/// This enum uses <b>binary</b> (base-1024) prefixes: <c>1 KB = 1024 B</c>,
/// <c>1 MB = 1024 KB</c>, and so on. These are the units commonly displayed by
/// operating systems and storage tools, even though the SI standard would call them
/// kibibyte (KiB), mebibyte (MiB), etc.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why binary, not decimal?</b> Storage capacity reported by Windows, Linux, and
/// most file managers uses base-1024 for KB/MB/GB. Using base-1000 would produce
/// values that differ from what users see in their file explorer, causing confusion
/// (e.g. a "500 GB" drive showing as "465 GB"). This type deliberately matches the
/// convention users actually observe.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Additional units (e.g. <c>TB</c>, <c>PB</c>) can be added later, but each addition
/// requires extending the conversion factor in <see cref="ValueObjects.DataSize"/>.
/// </para>
